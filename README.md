# xlsx_compare

`XLSX Compare` is a Python script that compares two Excel files, sheet by sheet, and identifies differences. This tool is particularly useful for quickly comparing large Excel files and generating an organized output of the differences.

---

## Features

1. **Sheet Comparison**:

   - Identifies sheets that exist only in one file.
   - Compares the contents of sheets present in both files.

2. **Handles Differences**:

   - Highlights cell-by-cell differences for sheets present in both files.
   - Writes differences into a separate sheet named `df-<sheet_name>`.

3. **Generates a Summary Sheet**:

   - Creates a `COMPARISON` sheet summarizing:
     - Sheets that exist only in `file1` or `file2`.
     - Sheets with no differences.
     - Sheets with differences.

4. **Organized Output**:

   - Sheets that exist in only one file are noted in the `COMPARISON` sheet.
   - Sheets with differences are written with only the changed cells in a new sheet.

5. **Performance Optimization**:

   - Uses `read_only=True` mode with `openpyxl` for processing large files efficiently.
   - Handles different sheet sizes by padding smaller sheets to match dimensions.

6. **User-Friendly CLI**:

   - Accepts file paths as parameters.
   - Optionally, allows specifying the output filename.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later.
- Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

---

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
python xlsx_compare.py <file1.xlsx> <file2.xlsx> [output.xlsx]
```

- `<file1.xlsx>`: Path to the first Excel file.
- `<file2.xlsx>`: Path to the second Excel file.
- `[output.xlsx]` (optional): Name of the output file. Defaults to `comparison_output.xlsx`.

### Example

```bash
python xlsx_compare.py data1.xlsx data2.xlsx result.xlsx
```

## Example Output

### COMPARISON Sheet

| **Sheet Name** | **Status**        |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| `File 1`       | file1.xlsx        |
| `File 2`       | file2.xlsx        |
|                |                   |
| `Sheet1`       | No differences    |
| `Sheet2`       | Only in file1     |
| `Sheet3`       | Only in file2     |
| `Sheet4`       | Differences found |

### Sheet with Differences (e.g., `df-Sheet4`)

| **Cell A1**        | **Cell A2** |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| `Value1 -> Value2` | `...`       |

## Debugging

- **Row Count Issue**:
  - By default, `pandas.read_excel` treats the first row as the header. To compare all rows, the script uses `header=None`.
- **Performance**:
  - The script uses `read_only=True` for large files to reduce memory usage.
- **Shapes Mismatch**:
  - Pads the smaller DataFrame with empty values to match the dimensions of the larger DataFrame.

---

## Color-Coded Logs

The script provides color-coded logs for better readability:

- **Cyan**: Processing progress.
- **Yellow**: Sheets only in one file. (TODO)
- **Green**: Sheets being compared. (TODO)
- **Blue**: Sheets with no differences. (TODO)
- **Red**: Sheets with differences.

---

## Known Issues

1. **DataFrames with Different Shapes**:

   - Handled by padding smaller DataFrames with empty values.

2. **Hidden Characters in Data**:
   - Automatically strips leading/trailing whitespace.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Improve comparison speed by leveraging optimized pandas operations.
2. Add support for additional file formats (e.g., `.csv`).
3. Interactive mode for selecting sheets to compare.
